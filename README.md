We are KayDeesFeet and our project is called KayDee. Our group members consists of Chai Yong Kang and Shaun Heng. We chose to focus on an e-commerce store selling basketball jerseys and shoes. We also gamified our web application by adding lucky spins and events to help further enhance the user experience. 

Design Process:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This website targets people from all age groups as everyone can benefit and gain something from this web application. People of younger generation can shop around easier and find their desired goods while people of older generation can reap the rewards of using our store to shop. 

As a younger generation person, I want to find and purchase easily accessible basketball shoes.

As a middle generation person, I want to purchase something from the comfort of my own home.

As a person of older age, I want to purchase something from the comfort of my own home and gain benefits when I use this app to purchase goods.

Features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This web application features the use of SketchFab 3D model visualisation to allow users to have a 360 view of our products that we are selling.

This web application also features a checkout form that is well designed and looks good to ensure users have a good experience when checking out their products.

This web application features usage of lottie animation to enhance the interactivity and looks of the webpage.

This web application features the use of JavaScript which is a link to rest db database when users sign in using their emails and passwords, it will be stored to RestDB.
